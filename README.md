# Jump Game for Glyph Matrix

## About the Game
This is a jumping game designed specifically for the Nothing Phone 3's Glyph Matrix display. The game features:

- **Physics-based gameplay** with gravity and jumping mechanics
- **Tilt controls** using the device's accelerometer for left/right movement
- **Multiple platform types** including normal, bouncy, and moving platforms
- **Dynamic camera system** that follows the player upward
- **Scoring system** with high score tracking

## Game Controls
- **Long-press** the Glyph Button to start/pause/restart the game
- **Tilt** your phone left or right to control the player's horizontal movement
- **Jump** on platforms to climb higher and increase your score
- **Avoid falling** off the bottom of the screen

## Game Mechanics
- **Screen wrapping**: Player can move from one side of the screen to the other
- **Auto-generation**: New platforms are generated as you climb higher
- **Multiple platform types**: 
  - Normal platforms (80%) - standard jump
  - Bouncy platforms (15%) - super jump
  - Moving platforms (5%) - horizontal movement
